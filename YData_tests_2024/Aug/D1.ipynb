    "<p><span>Your twin favorite nephews are starting school in a few weeks, and you were put in charge of shopping for school supplies. Unfortunately, they are very jealous, so you must buy exactly the same supplies for both, and as you were unpacking you’ve realised a single item was lost somewhere along the way and doesn’t have a duplicate. Now you must quickly find the item in question and tuck it away before distributing the shopping to your nephews.</span><span></span><span></span></p>\n",
