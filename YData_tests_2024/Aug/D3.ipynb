    "  <p><span>Your twin favorite nephews are starting school in a few weeks, and you were put in charge of shopping for school supplies. Unfortunately, they are very jealous, so you must buy exactly the same supplies for both.</span></p>\n",
    "  <p><span>As you were unpacking you’ve realised that<strong> you’ve miscounted earlier</strong> (in D1-D2), and in fact </span><strong>two</strong><span> distinct items were lost somewhere along the way and don’t have a duplicate. Now you must quickly find the </span><strong>two items </strong><span>in question and tuck them away before distributing the shopping to your nephews.</span></p>\n",
    "  <p><span>You are given a <strong>non-empty</strong> list of integers <code>supplies</code> containing </span><code>n</code><span> items. Each item is represented by an integer <code>k</code> in the range <code>[-n,n]</code>. All items appear <strong>exactly</strong> twice except for <strong>two</strong> items which appear only once. Find and return these <strong>two</strong> unmatched items. You can return the answer in any order.</span></p>\n",
    "  <p><strong><span>As in D2, your solution here needs to handle large input sizes, so your solution must have a linear runtime complexity and constant space.</span></strong></p>\n",
