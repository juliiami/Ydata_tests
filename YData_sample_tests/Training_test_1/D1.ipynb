    "You are given a rectangular ﬁeld $T$ with $R$ rows and $C$ columns. Each cell of $T$ contains one of two possible characters: `’.’` or `’#’` (`’.’` marks a passable cell, and `’#’` marks an impassable cell). Determine if there a passable cell $(r,c)$, such that one can visit all passable cells starting from $(r,c)$ and moving each time only to one of the neighbouring passable cells (a neighbouring cell of $(x,y)$ is one of four cells sharing a common side with $(x,y)$).\n",
