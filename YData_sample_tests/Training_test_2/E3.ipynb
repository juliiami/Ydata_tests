    "In this question, you are asked to use your work in the two previous questions to oﬀer relevant products to a new member who has just made their ﬁrst purchase at the store.\n",

    "Given a list of 3 product IDs and their counts representing the client’s current history, you should ﬁnd and return the ID of the product with the highest predicted purchase count.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you should use the `similarity` function (from E2) to ﬁnd the most similar products to the ones in the new client’s purchase among all other products, predict how much of each product is the new customer likely to buy in the future using the formula below, and return the one among them with the highest predicted count.\n",
