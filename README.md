# Test Structure: 

The exam contains **7 main tasks** in total, in two separate sections: **Data Analysis** and **Programming**. Tasks **A, B, C** comprise the **data analysis section**, and tasks **D, E, F** comprise the **programming section**. The analysis section is composed of **statistics & probability** (Task A), **data interpretation** (Task B) and **data analysis** (Task C). Some of the tasks are broken into several subtasks, so for example task B is comprised of questions B1-B6. Those sub-tasks are displayed as an individual question in the test interface.


## Analytics section: 
The analytics section contains **3** main questions, with questions A and B having several sub-tasks (A1-A6, B1-B6). 

**A: Probability** — understanding of basic probability principles. 

**B: Data Interpretation** — You are provided with a dataset and some general information. You are requested to provide answers based on information contained in the data provided. The questions require you to perform calculations (arithmetic only) and smanipulate the data to obtain answers 

**C: Data Analysis** — You are provided with a dataset along with background information and data dictionary (when required). You are requested to analyse the data using any method you see fit, in order to gain understanding of patterns existing in the data to answer given questions. You may employ any analytical means and tools at your disposal (no specific tool required or recommended).


## Programming section: 

The programming section contains **3** questions, each with three sub-tasks (e.g. D1-D3). You are required to **choose 2 out of the 3 questions** in this section (e.g. questions D and F but not E). If you select to complete all 3 questions, and do so successfully, you will receive bonus points - but keep in mind that it's very difficult to complete the exam on time even without extra tasks.

During the exam, you are expected to complete as many tasks as you are able. You should note however, that completing the exam in full in the allotted time is very difficult. It is recommended you read all the exam first and **plan your time accordingly**.
